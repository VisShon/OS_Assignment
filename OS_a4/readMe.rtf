\f0\fs24 \cf0 In this question I have created two processes producer and consumer processes, the producer function is used to open and read a random string from \'93/dev/urandom\'94 and puts it to a buffer which acts as a queue using writer syscall which i have added, we have used a semaphore stack_empty and a semaphore stack_full in which the stack_empty is initialised with value 5 and each time we put a value in the queue we turn up the stack_full semaphore and turn down the stack_empty semaphore and when we read we do vice versa. we have also used lock semaphore to deal with the problem when producer has not written yet producer tries to receive.}
