\f0\fs24 \cf0 The unix domain sockets use a client-server approach for inter process communication the first process behaves as a client which sends an array of random strings which we created using the random string method along with an array of their respective ids, it does so by first creating a domain socket using the socket() function and then connecting the message with it using the connect() function it then writes the data on the socket and waits for the response .the ids are then received by the second process which behaves as a server which receives the chunk of the string along the ids that the client process had sent, it does so by binding the message struct and the socket and then uses the listen and accept function to receive the message the message is then read and then it prints it  then it sends the highest index to the client process which prints the highest index and this loop continues until the highest index becomes 49.}
