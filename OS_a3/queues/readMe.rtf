\f0\fs24 \cf0 In this part of question 2 we have used the method known as message passing queues for inter process communication which uses structured messages for sending data between the processes. we first create a random id ands use the msgget function to create a message to send and then use the msgsnd to send a chunk of the string that we created using random string method  along with the respective ids then the process 2 recieves the same using msgrcv function which is then printed an the highest id is sent back to the process 1 which is printed and then this loop continues till the highest id is 49. we have use msgctl with IPC_RMID control to remove the message queue after it is used.}
